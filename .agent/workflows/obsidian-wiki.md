# Obsidian Wiki — Workflow Registry

Each command above maps to a `SKILL.md` in `.skills/`. When a user invokes one
of these commands, read the mapped skill file and follow its instructions
exactly. The skills handle vault path resolution, manifest tracking, and
`[[wikilink]]` connectivity on their own.

For the full routing table (all 15+ skills), see `AGENTS.md` at the repo root.
