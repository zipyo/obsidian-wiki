# Obsidian Wiki — Agent Context

A **skill-based framework** for building and maintaining an Obsidian knowledge base. No scripts or dependencies — everything is markdown instructions that you execute directly.

## Configuration

Resolve config using the Config Resolution Protocol in `llm-wiki/SKILL.md`:

1. **Walk up from CWD** — look for a `.env` file in the current directory, then each parent, up to `$HOME`. Stop at the first `.env` that contains `OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH`.
2. **Global config** — if no local `.env` is found, read `~/.obsidian-wiki/config`.
3. **Prompt setup** — if neither exists, tell the user to run `wiki-setup`.

The resolved config sets `OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH` (where the wiki lives). It may also set `OBSIDIAN_WIKI_REPO` (where this repo is cloned) and other optional variables.

**After reading config, always read `$OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH/AGENTS.md` if it exists.** It contains owner-specific conventions (domain vocabulary, ingest preferences, writing style, project scoping) that override framework defaults for all skills. Apply it for the duration of the session.

## Vault Structure

```
$OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH/
├── index.md                # Master index — every page listed, always kept current
├── log.md                  # Chronological activity log (ingests, updates, lints)
├── hot.md                  # Session hot cache — ~500-word semantic snapshot of recent activity
├── .manifest.json          # Tracks every ingested source: path, timestamps, pages produced
├── _meta/
│   ├── taxonomy.md         # Controlled tag vocabulary
│   └── *.base              # Obsidian Bases dashboard definitions (wiki-dashboard skill)
├── _insights.md            # Graph analysis output (hubs, bridges, dead ends)
├── _raw/                   # Staging area — drop rough notes here, next ingest promotes them
├── concepts/               # Abstract ideas, patterns, mental models
├── entities/               # Concrete things — people, tools, libraries, companies
├── skills/                 # How-to knowledge, techniques, procedures
├── references/             # Factual lookups — specs, APIs, configs
├── synthesis/              # Cross-cutting analysis connecting multiple concepts
├── journal/                # Time-bound entries — daily logs, session notes
└── projects/
    └── <project-name>.md   # One page per project synced via wiki-update
```

Every wiki page has required frontmatter: `title`, `category`, `tags`, `sources`, `created`, `updated`. Pages connect via internal links — `[[wikilinks]]` by default, or standard Markdown links when `OBSIDIAN_LINK_FORMAT=markdown` is set in config.

## Skill Routing

Skills live in `.skills/<name>/SKILL.md`. Match the user's intent to the right skill:

## Cross-Project Usage

The main use case: you're working in some other project and want to sync knowledge into your wiki or query it. Two global skills handle this — `wiki-update` and `wiki-query`. They work from any directory.

### wiki-update (write to wiki)

1. Resolve config using the Config Resolution Protocol to get `OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH`
2. Scan the current project: README, source structure, git log, package metadata
3. Distill what's worth remembering (architecture decisions, patterns, trade-offs — not code listings)
4. Write to `$VAULT/projects/<project-name>.md`, cross-linking to concept/entity pages as needed
5. Update `.manifest.json`, `index.md`, and `log.md`

On repeat runs, it checks `last_commit_synced` in `.manifest.json` and only processes the delta via `git log <last_commit>..HEAD`.

### wiki-query (read from wiki)

1. Resolve config using the Config Resolution Protocol to get `OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH`
2. Scan titles, tags, and `summary:` frontmatter fields first (cheap pass)
3. Only open page bodies when the index pass can't answer
4. Return a synthesized answer with `[[wikilink]]` citations

## Visibility Tags (optional)

Pages can carry a `visibility/` tag to mark their intended reach. **This is entirely optional** — untagged pages behave exactly as they always have (visible everywhere). The system stays single-vault, single source of truth.

| Tag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| *(no tag)* | Same as `visibility/public` — visible in all modes |
| `visibility/public` | Explicitly public — visible in all modes |
| `visibility/internal` | Team-only — excluded when querying in filtered mode |
| `visibility/pii` | Sensitive data — excluded when querying in filtered mode |

**Filtered mode** is opt-in, triggered by phrases like "public only", "user-facing answer", "no internal content", or "as a user would see it" in a query. Default mode shows everything.

`visibility/` tags are **system tags** — they don't count toward the 5-tag limit and are listed separately from domain/type tags in the taxonomy.

See `wiki-query` and `wiki-export` skills for how the filter is applied.

## Core Principles

- **Compile, don't retrieve.** The wiki is pre-compiled knowledge. Update existing pages — don't append or duplicate.
- **Track everything.** Update `.manifest.json` after ingesting, `index.md`, `log.md`, and `hot.md` after any write operation.
- **Connect with `[[wikilinks]]`.** Every page should link to related pages. This is what makes it a knowledge graph, not a folder of files.
- **Frontmatter is required.** Every wiki page needs: `title`, `category`, `tags`, `sources`, `created`, `updated`.
- **Single source of truth.** Visibility tags shape how content is surfaced — they don't duplicate or separate it.
- **Keep context warm.** `hot.md` is a ~500-word semantic snapshot of recent activity. Every write skill updates it so the next session can pick up where the last one left off without crawling the full vault.
